This is my BS final project on writing an interpreter for REXX programming language under DOS operating system.

I've used Borland C++ 4.5 compiler to compile the code of this project.

Internet was not spread in Iran when I was writing this interpreter. 
Therefore my knowledge about REXX was based on what Dr. Towhidi taught me and some few documents.

REXX is a very simple programming language for beginner. 
But somehow writing its interpreter is hard especially when you want to write it on DOS with limited RAM support.

In the first course of computer programming, Dr. Towhidi taught REXX on IBM 370. 
We used mainframe terminal to code our first programs. 

A few PC 286s were in computer laboratory of computer department of Shiraz university on those days. 
DOS was the operating system of those PCs.
But more and more PCs were added to the laboratory which able us to use them for 
running DOS applications specially Turbo C.

My project was based on my suggestion to Dr. Towhidi for writing an interpreter for REXX on DOS in 1996.

This project took a lot of time of me. Because it was the first time that I wanted to write an interpreter and I had 
a little practical and theoretical knowledge to how to write an interpreter.

My last major changes on the source code of this interpreter was on September 1999.

Please take a look at "valuevar.cpp" file. It took me long time to solve the problems of this part of interpreter
because of the interesting behavior of variables in REXX and my emphasize on full object oriented programming.
