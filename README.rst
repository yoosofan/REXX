This is my BS final project on writing an interpreter for REXX programming language under DOS operating system.

Borland C++ 4.5 compiler had used to compile the code of this project.

Internet was not spread in Iran when I was build this interpreter. Therefore my knowledge about REXX was based on what Dr. Towhidi taught me and some few documents. 

In the first course of computer programming, Dr. Towhidi taught REXX on IBM 370. We used mainframe terminal to code our first programs. 

A few PC 286s were in computer laboratory of computer department of Shiraz university on those days. DOS was the operating system of those PCs.
But more and more PCs were added to the laboratory which we was able to use them for running Turbo C.

My project was based on my suggestion to Dr. Towhidi for writing an interpreter for REXX on DOS. 

This project took a lot of time of me. because it was the first time that I want to write an interpreter.

REXX is a very simple programming language for beginner. But somehow writing its interpreter is hard especially when you want to write it on DOS with limited RAM support.
